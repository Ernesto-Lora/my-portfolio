<h1>SMS Spam detection </h1>

<p>
  We have a collection of spam messages gathered from the Grumbletext website, where users public spam messages. Additionally, we have randomly selected legitimate messages, which were collected for research purposes by the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore.

<h2>Exploratory Data Analisys</h2>

<p>Let's see some sample messages: </p>

<ul> Ham Message
  <li>Nah I don't think he goes to usf, he lives around here though</li>
  <li>Even my brother is not like to speak with me.</li>

  <li>I've cried enough today</li>
  <li>I HAVE A DATE ON SUNDAY WITH WILL!!</li>
  <li>Oh k...I'm watching here :) </li>
</ul>

<p>We can see that the legitimate (Ham) messages come from casual conversations, while the spam messages attempt to fool the recipient. </p> 

  <h2>Model </h2>
  
<p>Our approach is to vectorize the sentences, where each unique word will be represented as a binary column, as shown in the next figure.</p>

<p>This enable us to take each word as a numeric feature and lead us to
  use Regressions.

<p> Accuracy: 0.72</p>


<p>In the context of this particular problem, a false positive incurs significant costs for the Credit Card Company. Our baseline model achieves an accuracy of 0.73 but results in many false positives. The Random Forest model shows a significant improvement, achieving an accuracy of 0.81 and producing far fewer false positives. Lastly, the Neural Network approach does not outperform as expected, but it provides a solid accuracy of 0.81, similar to the Random Forest approach.
